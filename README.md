## Usage

The purpose of this webpage is to provide a simple work day planner for the user. This webpage can be used to help supplement keeping a persons daily tasks organized and to keep track of potential hourly deadlines.

 
- Given that the user's work hours represent standard business hours (9am to 5pm):

        * The user is provided with nine rows, each row representing a work hour during the day
        (I.E: The first row is representative of 9am, the next for 10am, etc.).

        * For each row, each hour is provided with an input field to hold text based information.
        As time passes through out the work day, each input field is color coded for when time
        has passed each represented hour:

                - If it is before the time representative of the row, the input fields background color is green.

                - If it is during the time representative of the row & before the proceeding hour, the input fields
                background color is red.

                - If it is after the time representative of the row, the input fields background color is gray.

        * If the user desires to close the window, but also wishes to maintain the existence of
        information left in the input field, the user has the option to save the information
        by simply pressing the save button at the end of the row. They can then refresh/close the window & comeback to the website without information disappearing from the input field.

## Conclusion

What I learned the most of during the course of this assignment was the usefulness of the javascript library, jQuery. What really got me excited to get going with this assignment was to see how jQuery affects how I write out my code; during my last assignment, I felt that though I think I had a decent grasp of the material, my code could have been cleaner looking in the end product. With the use of jQuery, I was able to write my code in a very clean and efficient fashion. Comparing the code that I wrote for this assignment to my past assignments, it is almost night and day for how much more readable my code is with jQuery verses applying just standard Javascript/DOM manipulation. 
Another javascript library that I learned about during this assignment was moment.js; I can definitely see how useful this library can be when dealing with time as a factor on a webpage. I'm excited to see all the different functions/methods the moment.js library provides for any future projects I may have. After learning about DOM manipulation and how jQuery works (fundamentally at least), I feel that I can incorporate more effective writing practices when I code and more importantly be more conscious of finding more ways to be efficient.
I think what will make my project stand out is how close I got my webpage to look like wireframe and also how organized I kept my javascript!
